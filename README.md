# LykosOS

An operating System with Arch Linux

I have decided to run an Arch Linux distribtion with a script that will help you load what is needed to start what is needed for any one going into linux as a beginner or an advanced user.  I just use it for cyber security since that is what I am going into.  These are just my personal programs. This is just a script for right now.  This is the beta version while I currently create the iso.  I am still trying to create this distro and put the right tools together for basic use.
