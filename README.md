# LykosOS - A Linx distribution with a touch of nix, introduced into the database that can run containers. 

An operating System with Arch Linux + NixOS

I have decided to run an Arch Linux distribtion with Nix because this is my own personal operating system that I have configured and decided to release it to the work. 

This is just the testing area for the OS.  An iso will be coming soon....link coming soon......
